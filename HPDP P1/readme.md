## 🔍 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a high-performance data pipeline capable of extracting and processing **at least 100,000 structured records** from a dynamic web source. Our selected website is **[Lazada Malaysia](https://www.lazada.com.my)**.

We designed a system that:
- Crawls and scrapes data using `Selenium` and `BeautifulSoup`.
- Stores raw and cleaned data in a **MongoDB Atlas** database.
- Performs cleaning using both **Pandas (baseline)** and **Polars (optimized)** methods.
- Evaluates and compares performance improvements.

## 🎯 Goals and Deliverables

- ✅ Collect large-scale Lazada product data
- ✅ Clean and transform datasets using Python tools
- ✅ Apply high-performance techniques (lazy execution, parallelism)
- ✅ Compare Pandas vs Polars in terms of speed and efficiency
- ✅ Submit a full report, cleaned dataset, source code, and performance analysis

📄 **Report, code, and results** are organized in the respective subfolders.
