# 📦 Lazada Web Crawling and Data Optimization Project

Welcome to our project repository!

This project is developed as part of our coursework under HPDP P1 (Group 4). Our goal is to extract product data from the Lazada e-commerce platform and analyze it through a structured data pipeline.

---

## 🛠️ What We Did

- Crawled product listings from Lazada using Python-based tools.
- Collected and stored raw product data in a cloud-based MongoDB database.
- Applied two versions of data cleaning:
  - **Baseline** using standard `pandas`
  - **Optimized** using `polars` for better performance
- Evaluated the performance between basic and optimized data processing methods.
